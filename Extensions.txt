floating point arithmetic
double prec fp arithmetic
arbitrary prec fp arithmetic
32 bit load hex
arbitrary bit load hex
64 bit instructions
repetitive ops (e.g. do next op x times moving sp n each time)
vector operations
change conditional from lez to ez, gez, nez, etc.
additionally an op could be sent to "turn on" and "turn off" a specific functional unit
  Such as the decode unit to begin CISC style instructions, or vector, or fp, etc.
  Allowing for asm portability (but not binary portability) between CPUs of different complexity
  This also enables very reduced power consumption, as decode is single stage for D-RISC
