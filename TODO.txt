1. Create a better means of producing masks
      a. You can load a 32 bit HEX
      b. But when the shift amount is determined by a register, the mask currently takes a loop to make
2. Finish all synthesized procedures:
      Logical Shift Left
3. Create a RSVD function call for all blocks
4. Determine if XNOR or XOR
5. load32
6. load16
