1.  Decide if load 
      a. zeroes out bits b31:b8 OR
      b. does nothing to bits b31:b8
2. How to do arithmetic shift
3. Create a better means of producing masks
      a. You can load a 32 bit HEX
      b. But when the shift amount is determined by a register, the mask currently takes a loop to make
