The Timing simulation for commands will need to be complete as NL begins to be pipelined.
The possibility for race conditions reachs certainty when dealing with instructions that contain different amounts to finish


The simulation will begin in C++, and will remain in C++ for the foreseeable future.
The possibility exists of writing the simulation in C, as I am more familiar with that language, but C++ OOP would be mightily beneficial.

The intent is to have a simulation that:

1) Takes Binary
2) Simulates timing for binary
3) Validates functionality
4) Finds optimizations
